From a\\ntotal of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13\\nto the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of\\n4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates\\nan input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range\\n0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small\\ndistortions.\\n\\nFor info on NIST preprocessing routines, see M. D. Garris, J. L. Blue, G.\\nT. Candela, D. L. Dimmick, J. Geist, P. J.
